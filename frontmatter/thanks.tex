%% \newthought{Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet},

This thesis would not have been possible
without the ideas, guidance, and patience
of my supervisors, Aidan Feeney and Jonathan Rolison.
I thank them for keeping me on message whenever I went off,
and keeping me inspired whenever I was frustrated.
I also thank the postgraduate community at QUB
--- they know who they are ---
for listening to me complain
in the understanding that
I would listen to them do the same.
Thanks are also due to my family and friends in the real world,
for their support, and for pretending to be interested in my research.
Finally, my heartfelt thanks go to Orla,
who got stuck with me as an undergraduate,
put up with me as a graduate student,
and hopefully gets the reward of listening to me as a doctor. Thank you.
