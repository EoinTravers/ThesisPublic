In this Appendix, I plot the time course analyses
for Experiment 6, reported in Chapter 6,
separately for each of the eight CRT problems.
The text of the conflict and no-conflict versions
of the eight items are shown in Appendix~\ref{appendix:exp6_stimuli}.

For clarity, I use labels to refer to each CRT problems.
Therefore, problems 1, 2, and 3 in Appendix~\ref{appendix:exp6_stimuli}
\citep[the original CRT items, from][]{Frederick2005} will be referred to as
the \emph{bat-and-ball}, \emph{widgets}, and \emph{lily pad} problems respectively.
Similarly, problems 5 -- 8, adapted from \citet{Primi2015},
will be referred to the
\emph{coin} (4),
\emph{elves} (5),
\emph{running track} (6),
\emph{grades} (7),
and \emph{athletics team} (8)
problems.
