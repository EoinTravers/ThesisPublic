Following previous intuitive logic studies \citep[e.g.][]{Mevel2014}
I calculated the number of heuristic responses given
by each participant on conflict problems, 
and categorised each participant as either
``majority heuristic'' (3 or 4 heuristic responses out of four, 53 participants)
or ``minority heuristic'' (0 to 2 heuristic responses, 75 participants).
In this appendix, I repeat the time course analyses
reported for Experiment 6 separately for each group of participants.
As none of the trends differ qualitatively from the results
reported in Chapter 6 in ways that affect my conclusions,
I do not provide interpretation of each individual figure.
