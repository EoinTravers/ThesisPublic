\subsection{Cursor trajectories}


As described in Chapter 2,
cursor transition probabilities were calculated for each condition.
When base rates and descriptions disagreed,
participants initially moved towards
the option cued by the description on 66\% of trials,
selected this option after initially moving towards it 89\% of the time,
and selected the base rate-cued option after
initially moving towards it 36\% of the time.

There was a significant main effect of the description type
on the proportion, $\alpha$ of trials where
initially moved towards the base rate-cued option
($\chi^2$ = 135.9, DF = 2, p < .0001).
Participants were most likely to initially move towards
this option
when the description also cued it (69.4\%),
less likely when the description was uninformative (57.4\%)
and least likely when the description cued the alternative option (33.9\%).
Pairwise comparisons between each description type
were all statistically significant
(z's > 3.9, p's < .001).

$\beta$ indicates the proportion of trials
where participants selected the base rate-cued option
after initially moving towards it.
There was a significant main effect of description type on this measure
($\chi^2$ = 262.7, DF = 2, p < .0001).
Participants were most likely to select the base rate-cued option
after initially moving towards it
when the description also cued that option (96.5\% of trials),
less likely when the description was uninformative (79.1\%)
and least likely when the description cued the alternative option (36.1\%).
Pairwise comparisons between each description type
were again all statistically significant
(z's > 5, p's < .0001).


Lastly, $\gamma$ reflects the proportion
of trials where participants selected the base rate-cued option
after initially moving towards the alternative option.
There was a significant main effect of description type
($\chi^2$ = 301.4, DF = 2, p < .0001).
Participants were most likely to change direction
and select the base rate-cued option
after initially moving towards the alternative
when the description agreed with the base rate (89.5\% of trials),
less likely when the description was uninformative (56.3\%),
and were very unlikely to change direction
when that alternative was cued by the description (11.2\%).
Pairwise comparisons between each description type
were once again all statistically significant
(z's > 5, p's < .0001).

These results show that description interfered with
participants' base rate-based reasoning at every juncture,
influencing both their initial mouse movements,
and their subsequent responses,
regardless of their initial movement.

The transition probability analysis was repeated
to explore the effect of manipulating the base rate
on participants' movements towards the description-cued option.
Transition probabilities,
broken down according to the base rate,
are shown in Table~\ref{tab:exp5_desc_transitions}.
Here, $\alpha$ represents the proportion of trials
where participants initially moved towards the description-cued option.
There was no main effect of base rate on this proportion
($\chi^2$  = 1.5, DF = 2, p > .4):
participants initially moved towards the description-cued option
on average 68\% of the time,
regardless of the base rate information.

There were, however, main effects of base rate type
on $\beta$, the proportion of trials where
the description-cued option was selected after
participants initially moved towards it,
and $\gamma$, the proportion of trials where
the it  was selected after
participants initially moved towards the alternative option
($\chi^2$s  > 30, DF = 2, p's < .0001).
In both cases, participants were less likely
to ultimately select the description-cued option
when the base rate cued the other response option
than when the base rate was uninformative
or when it agreed with the description
(z's > 3, p's < .001; see Table~\ref{tab:exp5_desc_transitions}).

Therefore, base rates had no early impact on participants'
description-based reasoning,
and did not influence their initial mouse movements.
They showed some effect, however, on ultimate responses,
as participants were less likely to select the description-cued option,
regardless of what direction they initially moved the cursor.
