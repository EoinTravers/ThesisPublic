# The Dynamics of Conflict in Reasoning

This repository contains the .tex source files for my PhD thesis, 
*The Dynamics of Conflict in Reasoning*,
supervised by Dr Aidan Feeney & Dr Jonathan Rolison at Queenâ€™s University Belfast,
and completed in May 2016.

To build the final document, you'll need to install `XeLaTeX` and `Inkscape` (and possibly some other things I've taken for granted).
To build it, exectute

```
bash scripts/BUILD
```

This will convert all of the relevant svg images to pdfs,
and run xelatex and bibtex as needed.

At present, one LaTeX error is raised during the process,
which I think can safely be ignored by hitting enter.
